# Hello World! #

My name is Camille Arce and I am on a journey to pivot my career in tech and learn coding languages. I recently joined DPI's Tech Apprentice program where I am learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails. My ultimate goal is to master Ruby on Rails and learn Python and SQL in the future to become well-versed in the industry.

This is my first repository and I am excited to share my journey with you!

## Project Description ##

In this project, I created a basic web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned about cascading style, user interface design, and adding dynamic features to create a user-friendly web application. This project was a great way for me to apply what I learned in class and gain hands-on experience.

## Challenges ##
One of the biggest challenges I faced in this project was learning how to use GitHub. As a beginner, there was a bit of a learning curve, but with practice and guidance from my instructors, I was able to figure it out.

## Installation ##
To view the code for this project, simply visit the "hello-world" repository on my GitHub account.

## Conclusion ##
Thank you for stopping by my first repository! I hope you enjoyed learning about my journey and my first project. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or comments.
